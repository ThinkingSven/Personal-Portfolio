      <p>Yo! I'm a full-stack engineer from the United Kingdom. I care about performant, accessible code. I'm a huge fan of making, reading and contributing to open source & you can sponsor me on GitHub. Programming since seven, I've learned a lot about core programming principles, scaling, and systems architecture. I always love to joke around and I take my Twitter presence very seriously...</p>
